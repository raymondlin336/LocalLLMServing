Branch: Function Calling
Commit: -
 - Added verified_models.json so the list of models that the users can choose in the UI from is directly picked from here.
 - Added an actual valid function calling: real time weather
 - Enabled recursive calling for model requests
 - UI modifications:
    - only have ui elements like the image row if images are supported
    - added checkbox for using function calling for available models
    - reset window default size, enabled text warping
 - Disabled model thinking
 - Enabled model unloading when app is launched
 - Get non-function-calling models working under the current framework
