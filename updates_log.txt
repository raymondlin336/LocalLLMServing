Branch: Function Calling
Commit: -
 - Added verified_models.json so the list of models that the users can choose in the UI from is directly picked from here.
 - Added an actual valid function calling: real time weather []
 - Modified UI so checkbox for funciton calling appears when the chosen model supports it []
